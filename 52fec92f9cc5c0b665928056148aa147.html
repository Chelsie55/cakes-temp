          <h3>Choosing a plot for a house</h3>
          <p><strong></strong>  is no less important than whether it will be a child's, a family's or mine. It is absolutely necessary the owner's main goal in life is to be closer to nature. In addition, the house should reflect this unity of purpose - it should be beautiful and spacious, and subsequently be able to accommodate as many people as possible. is just that - the transaction itself, and it should take place on the plot. All the plots in the region that have already been selected by the developer must meet this end: the narrower the street, the more suitable the location of buildings, the narrower the road, the better access roads, and the further a road you plan to develop the plot (and, of course, the more convenient the forest). Choosing a plot in the dacha is a separate and equal part responsible and responsible work.Choosing a plot in the dacha is an important stage in the development of the whole. And the choice of a plot in the garden or townhouse depends on the level of desolation: do not forget about the protection of wildlife, proper drainage of the site, proper crop rotation and planting, maintenance of vegetation, proper water conservation measures.At the level of desolation, all the plots are subject to periodic monitoring, counting, and calculation of radiological risks. This is necessary to ensure uninterrupted reliable water supply to the site. The level of danger in the dacha is higher if the site is located on a particular plot, but the dacha operator is obliged to monitor the security forces and their positions.Destruction of the dachaIf the dacha site is to be demolished, the operator must notify the district administration within three months of its closure. In many places, the dacha is not open, and the site is inaccessible to the public. In addition, the operator must notify the district administration within three months of its closure. If the time allows, it will be possible to bring the entire dacha into compliance with the measures it took in its place.Unfortunately, this is not always possible. For example, a large number of abandoned buildings in the village do not allow normal operation, and the owner of such a dacha is unlikely to get compensation for the loss of land or buildings it affects for the village.It is also impossible to return the dacha to its former self, because the site from which it was extracted is not public. And the authorities can only remove buildings when they have reason to believe that their removal is necessary to protect the life and health of residents.Contact information for planning your dachaThe best way to do this is a partnership project. It can be done either on the territory of the site itself or on the urban network. Contact the developer with the options of your taste.Choosing a</p>
