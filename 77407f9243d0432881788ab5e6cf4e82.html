          <h3>Houses for sale are different shapes and sizes</h3>
          <p><strong></strong> Many people dream of a house with a solid, picturesque and beautiful layout, surrounded by nature and protected from all the problems of living by a hipped roof, uneven walls, uneven floors, uneven access to fresh air and a septic tank. But what if you need a different look? Here are the types of projects that can satisfy these requirements:Single-storey commercial and industrial buildings are built by the method of partitioning land plots using a shared-ownership construction trust (POP). The share of the plots belongs to each owner, they decide what the entire area should be and what buildings should be provided to the shared owner. The share should not be too small, for example, for a small plot, it can be more than 8 acres. The owner of a land plot has the right to make a separate arrangement for a different area of land, taking into account the area of the land on each of the plots. The rights to the selected area are usually specified in the agreement.In some cases, it is necessary to include a license for the construction of structures with a permitted design, which gives the right to use the land for construction. In such cases, it is necessary to make a preliminary agreement specifying the area of the land and the location of the building.It is important that the plot with the specified area is not subject to development by neighbors, they do not have the right to build on their behalf any individual building.However, in almost all cases, the boundaries of the area are managed by the owners of the land plots. After all, the shared ownership of the land is taken by all the plots members of the PVE unit are entitled to use the land for their own purposes.For example, a plot with a height of 6.7 m2 is developed according to the agreement. But neighbors have the right to build a house 7.7 m2 on their own land. In accordance with the agreement, neighbors can arrange a separate gas boiler house 3 m2 on each of their adjacent plots, which has a separate entrance and a separate exit from the site.The timing of the settlement of disputes is important. For example, neighbors may agree that the building on their land is required for a shed or garage that is located in a residential building area, and that the customer wants to build a carport there. Therefore, the issue of a written consent for the settlement of disputes may be required.Compliance with the settlement procedure is not allowed if the settlement agreement does not specify the area of settlement. For example, in the case of a written consent for the settlement of disputes over a plot of land owned by the owner of a residential building, the owner of the plot has the right to determine the boundaries of the settlement.However, the section on written consent for the settlement of disputes usually covers only a part of the territory of the</p>
